		<h3 class="text-secondary">Challenges</h3>
	</p>A callenge that I encountered when creating the protoypes was coming up with the design that would
	give the vibe of a breakfast website for the homepage.</p>
	<h3 class="text-secondary">Problems</h3>
</p>A problem that I encountered when creating a digital protoype is getting stuck on an image on illustrator. Although it
wasn't part of the requirement I felt that I needed to create a digital protoype to get the practice of how my team will use
photoshop and illustrator to design our website.</p>
		<h3 class="text-secondary">Results</h3>
	</p>As a result I was able to download a couple images and edit them by using both photoshop and illustrator. When I had a couple
	problems of not knowing how to use a special tool I would use youtube as a reference.
	</p>
	<h3 class="text-secondary">Feedback</h3>
</p> During our team feedback only Luis and Maddy participated during the class. Overall
we had the same idea of including images of food as well as masking them on photshop. The layout
that we created was similar. The only difference was the placement. Luis had an idea of including a slide
of different images on the homepage. Overall all of our ideas were similar and as a group we are going in the
direction that we want the design of our website to look like. Although what can be imporoved is adding more content
on the homepage.
