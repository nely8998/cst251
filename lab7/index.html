					<h2>PROBLEM</h2>
					<p>A problem that occured during lab#7 is trying to properly wrap image on css so it can appear on the right side of the screen
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="result">
						<h2>RESULTS</h2>
							<p>As a result I tried to workbackwards in order to figure out what the proper css rules would be when adding an image. I<br>
								was looking at multiple resources such as inspecting tool,google, and w3schools. Although I feel like I need more<br>
							 improvement on my webpage this is my first time getting familiar with css.
