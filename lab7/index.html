			<h1>Lab 7: Intro to CSS</h1>
			<h2>CHALLENGE</h2>
			<p> For Lab#7 a challenge that I had when beginning was how to create a new folder for this lab. Although a couple minutes later I was<br>
				I just decided to copy and paste the folder and files.
        </p>
				<h2>PROBLEM</h2>
					<p>A problem that occured during lab#7 is trying to properly wrap image on css so it can appear on the right side of the screen
					</p>
					<h2>RESULTS</h2>
							<p>As a result I tried to work backwards in order to figure out what the proper css rules are when adding an image. I<br>
								was looking at multiple resources such as inspecting tool, google, and w3schools. Although I feel like I need more<br>
							 improvement on my webpage this is my first time getting familiar with css.
