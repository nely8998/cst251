        <h2 class="color">challenge</h2>
        <p>For this week's lab I will be facing a couple challenges as we start to get more advanced in styling blocks. A challenge
					 that I currently have is being able to complete the task for the sidebar. As well as getting the correct height for each div so
					 my content doesn’t appear out of place.
            </p>
				<h2 class="color">problem</h2>
					<p>A problem that I had when styling the aside div is that it would show up<br>
						 below my content instead on the right side of the screen.I checked my index.css<br>
						  and realized I put the position to the right.
					</p>
					<div class="drink">
							<img src="../lab11/img/margarita.jpg" wdth="420">
						</div>
					<h2 class="color">results</h2>
							<p>As a result I double checked other sources to figure out why my content didn’t appear on the right. I decided to reference back to
								google presentation and ws3chools to help me complete the tasks for this lab. As you can see on your screen it appears on the right side.
								The change that I made is instead of position right I changed it to float right.
              </p>
