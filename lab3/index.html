		<h2 style="font-family:fantasy">CHALLENGES</h2>
		<p style="font-family:fantasy">During lab #3 I had to encounter a challenge such as not being able to add an image on Atom.<br>
			 The first time that I was able to add an image file on Atom I was able to locate it properly.  As I was<br>
			 getting done with the assignment I accidently deleted the folder of lab #2 and had to properly get it on atom once again.<br>
			  I lost my image that I had put on my file but this time I wasn’t able to right click add file to images. When I tried to<br>
				enter a path for the new file for my image it would open a new tab with my image in a seperate file.<br>
			</p>
			<h2 style="font-family:fantasy">RESULTS</h2>
			<p style="font-family:fantasy">As I struggled by trying to add an image file on atom for 2 hours I got frustrated that night.<br>
				 I was able to properly add images by right clicking add a new file to images and it was able to work the first time on Atom.<br>
				 I don’t know what I did wrong as I tried over and over again. The next day I decided to just locate my cst251 folder and<br>
				  click on my img folder. After that I just added my jpg image to that folder and it showed up on atom.<br>
