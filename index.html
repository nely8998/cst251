<p style="font-family:verdana">
  My name is Nely Flores, and I’m from Monterey California. I arrived in the United States when I was three years<br>
   old with my parents around 2003. I am originally from Guanajuato, Mexico but If you were to ask me if I remember.<br>
   I honestly wouldn't know. I spent all my childhood around the area of Monterey attending school. I never really<br>
   wanted to move somewhere else like everyone would because I needed to find myself. I appreciate the area because<br>
it has beautiful ocean and mountain views. I decided to attend California State University because it was a five<br>
minute drive. I was confused about what I wanted to study during my first two years of college. During this<br>
pandemic I went on a mission to find out what I really wanted to do. I realized I had fear. So that fear had to go <br>
away and that's how I ended in this class. My new major is Communication Design and I am excited to learn. Most<br>
importantly to create.</p>
<p style="font-family:verdana">
Some of my interests include playing the classical guitar when I get bored around the house.<br>
 I enjoy music very much from english to spanish. Last year every month I would attend music festivals with my friends.<br>
 Call me crazy but the environment and listening to music from different DJ’s across the globe is what caught my<br>
 attention. I am also currently taking a photography class from Youtube. The internet is amazing with awesome teachers.<br>
 Although right now my main focus is going to school I also love to learn about web design from youtubers that have been<br>
 in the game for years. I guess Youtube inspires me to just go for it. Technology gets a little bit overwhelming.. So 5x a<br>
 day I workout around 12pm. When I need a break from the world I hike around Carmel Valley and Garrapata.</p>
