		<h2 style="font-family:fantasy">CHALLENGES</h2>
		<p style="font-family:fantasy">During #4 I faced a challange of accidentally deleting my files on github. I accidentally pressed a button<br>
			 when I was working on a class for photoshop. When I tried to open it I clicked on a button to replace the original file with a blank one.<br>
			 This day was challenging because everything was working fine but then it was completely deleted. I realized how important it is to<br>
			 properly know how your computer works because it might delete your work. Luckily I saved my code on my laptop.I also stubbled into <br>
			 another challenge on my page such as the cst homepage link not working. All the other links are working just fine except for my homepage<br>
			 link. I even stayed after class to make sure I got the code right but since my whole work erased and did the same steps my link is still<br>
			  not working.<br>
			</p>
			<h2 style="font-family:fantasy">RESULTS</h2>
				<p style="font-family:fantasy">During lab #4 I was able to complete what was needed for my lab4/index html file. Although my partner and I<br>
					 were trying to find a solution for the homepage link to work we werenâ€™t able to figure out what was the problem.<br>
