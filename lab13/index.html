        <h2>challenge</h2>
        <p>This weeks challenge requires to sucessfully complete every task from lab thirteen.
				</p>
				<h2>problem</h2>
					<p>Some problems I ran into when creating the graphic design was the differnt positions to properly get
						my content where I wanted it to show up. Another problem that I had was that on my iframe everything was positioned
						off when taking a glance. Although on the fake.css it seemed to be well put together.
					</p>
					<h2>results</h2>
							<p>As a result I had to play around with the different positions since it was my first time adding multiple divs
							   using html and css. Along with my frame you are able to extend it to get the whole view.
              </p>
