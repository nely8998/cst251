 <p style="font-family:verdana">
My name is Nely Flores and I am a junior at California State University of Monterey Bay.I recently changed<br>
 my major to Communication Design with a concentration in Web Design. I am excited to learn more about<br>coding and
build coding skill sets that will help me create websites. My plan is to finish my degree at CSUMB and <br>start a
job in web development. My partner for this class is Kayla. She is originally from the Bay Area.<br> Kayla is
currently studying at CSUMB with a major of Communication Design and a concentration in Game Design.<br> Although
Kayla has never coded she is planning to gain coding skills to build her own website to promote her work.</p>
