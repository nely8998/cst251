        <h2>challenge</h2>
        <p>For this week's lab challenge consisted of challenging myself to do a more difficult graphic design.
				</p>
				<h2>problem</h2>
					<p>A problem that I encountered during this lab was my content overlapping one another. During this lab I also
						had some challenges when styling my css. The last problem that I had was that my css link would not show up. Although I
						do have it on my html.
					</p>
					<h2>results</h2>
							<p>As a result I had to do my research to figure out the positions of how to style html and css. I realized that I had some learning to
								do with the different positions when styling css. Overall these past two labs were challenging and made me go out of my own way to research the problems that
								I had in the interenet. As well it showed my the areas that I need some learning to do.
