			<h2>SUBJECT FOR THIS LAB</h2>
			<p> For Lab#6 my partner and I are working together to create an html file and then style it with a CSS file.</p>
					<h2>DIFFICULTIES</h2>
					<p>During lab #6 I was having trouble getting my index.css file to show up on my browser. I was able to get the code to<br>
					 link it but somehow on my the screen it would appear to be white.
					</p>
						<h2>RESULTS</h2>
							<p>As a result I decided to meet with my partner to figure out if there was an issue on my code. I was able to fix it<br>
								 as you can tell on your screen!</p>
