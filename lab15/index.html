        <h2 class="color">challenge</h2>
        <p>The challenge this week is no so much the tasks asked for this lab but rather the positions of the divs.
            </p>
				<h2 class="color">problem</h2>
					<p>A challenge that came up was that my content seemed to appear close together. If you look at your screen
						every different content seems to be right next to each other. What I would like my website to look like is to
						have some sort of spacing so it doesn't look like everything is crammed up.
					</p>
					<h2 class="color">results</h2>
							<p>As a result I wasn't able to figure out how to solve it. I was doing some of my research on w3schools but had
								no luck! At the end that was my only challenge but the lab made me realize what I need to work on!
